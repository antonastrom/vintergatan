                    • Registration

                    Elegance reserves the right to close an account if any user is seen to be using proxy IPs (Internet Protocol addresses) in order to attempt to hide the use of multiple accounts, or disrupts any of our services in any way.

                      • Submission of material

                    You own all of the content and information you post on the Website. In addition: 

                    For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (“IP content”), you specifically give us the following permission, subject to your privacy settings: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with Elegance (“IP License”). This includes for example and without limitation the right and license to use, reproduce, modify, edit, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform and display such material (in whole or part) worldwide and/or to incorporate it in other works in any form, media, or technology now known or later developed. In certain circumstances Elegance may also share your contribution with trusted third parties. 

                    This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account provided that your content may still be accessible if it has been shared with others, and we are not obligated to delete IP content shared by you. You also acknowledge that Elegance is not obliged to publish any material submitted by you on any Elegance publication.

                    When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).

                    When you use an application, your content and information is shared with the application. We require applications to respect your privacy, and your agreement with that application will control how the application can use, store, and transfer that content and information.

                    When you publish content or information using the “Public” setting, it means that you are allowing everyone, including other Website users , to access and use that information, and to associate it with you (i.e. your name and profile picture). We advise that you never reveal any personal information about yourself or anyone else (telephone number, home address, business address, delivery address or email address or any other details that would allow you to be personally identified).

                    We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about Elegance, but you understand that we may use them without any obligation to compensate you for them (just as you have no obligation to offer them).

                    By submitting any material to us, you agree to use the Elegance Community Areas in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms and Conditions.

                    If you do not want to grant Elegance the permission set out above on these terms, please do not submit or share your contribution on the Community Areas.

                    The Service provides you with the ability to interact with social media services, such as through Facebook “Like” buttons, Twitter and otherwise. These features may enable integration and/or access to your social media accounts. We do not control those social media services, your profiles on those services, modify your privacy settings on those services or establish rules about how your personal information on those services will be used. You and the social media service providers are in control of those issues, not Elegance. You are encouraged to read all policies and information on the applicable social media services to learn more about how they handle your information before using any such features made available to you on our Service. We are not responsible for any acts or omissions by any social media service provider or your use of features that come from their platform. <br>

                    By placing an order you are offering to purchase a product on and subject to the following terms and conditions. All orders are subject to availability and confirmation of the order price. 

                    Dispatch times may vary according to availability and any guarantees or representations made as to delivery times are subject to any delays resulting from postal delays or force majeure for which we will not be responsible. Please see our Delivery Charges notice for further information. 

                    In order to contract with Elegance you must be over 18 years of age and possess a valid credit or debit card issued by a bank acceptable to us. Elegance retains the right to refuse any request made by you, and Elegance reserves the right to close your Elegance account at its sole discretion. If your order is accepted we will inform you by email and we will confirm the identity of the party which you have contracted with. This will usually be Elegance or may in some cases be a third party. Where a contract is made with a third party Elegance is not acting as either agent or principal and the contract is made between yourself and that third party and will be subject to the terms of sale which they supply you. When placing an order you undertake that all details you provide to us are true and accurate, that you are an authorised user of the credit or debit card used to place your order and that there are sufficient funds to cover the cost of the goods. The cost of foreign products and services may fluctuate. All prices advertised are subject to such changes. Please be aware that some of the goods sold through our Websites may not be suitable for children under 18 years of age, so please take extra care when purchasing goods as gifts, for under 18’s. 


                    a. Our Contract


                    i. When you place an order, you will receive an acknowledgement e-mail confirming receipt of your order. This email will only be an acknowledgement and will not constitute acceptance of your order. A contract between us for the purchase of the goods will not be formed until your payment has been approved us and we have debited your credit or debit card. 


                    b. Pricing and Availability


                    i. Whilst we try and ensure that all details, descriptions and prices which appear on this Website are accurate, errors may occur. If we discover an error in the price of any goods which you have ordered we will inform you of this as soon as possible and give you the option of reconfirming your order at the correct price or cancelling it. If we are unable to contact you we will treat the order as cancelled. If you cancel and you have already paid for the goods, you will receive a full refund. Where applicable, prices are inclusive of VAT. Delivery costs will be charged in addition; such additional charges are clearly where applicable and included in the 'Total Cost'.

                    ii.The Service may contain typographical errors or other errors or inaccuracies and may not be complete or current. We therefore reserve the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions and to change or update information at any time without prior notice. We reserve the right to refuse to fill any orders that you may place based on information on the Service that may contain errors or inaccuracies, including, without limitation, errors, inaccuracies or out-of-date information regarding pricing, shipping, payment terms, or return policies.


                    c. Payment


                    i. Upon receiving your order we carry out a standard pre-authorisation check on your payment card to ensure there are sufficient funds to fulfil the transaction. Goods will not be dispatched until this pre-authorisation check has been completed. Your card will be debited once the order has been accepted. 


                    d. Discount Codes


                    Promotional discount codes - We may from time to time offer promotional discount codes which may apply in respect of any, or certain specified, purchases made though this Website.

                    The conditions of use relating to any discount code will be specified at the time of issue.

                    These T&Cs relate to all Elegance promotions, competitions and discount codes (unless otherwise stated). 

                    a) Only one promotion code can be used per order. A promotional code can't be used after an order has been placed. 

                    b) Maximum pre-discount spend limit of £500 applies per order. 

                    c) If the promotional code has expired, then you shouldn’t try to use it. Also you can’t swap your promotional code for cash. 

                    d) If you’ve been given a promotional discount code, then it can only be used by you on your own Elegance account for the purpose for which it was issued. 

                    e) You shouldn’t pass your promotional code around your friends, or post it in a forum – you should keep it confidential and only use it for your own purchases through the Website. 

                    f) Look after your promotional code, because we are not obliged to provide you with a replacement and abuse of the code if it inadvertently gets lost and used by someone else will result in its cancellation. 

                    g) Brand or product category exclusions may also apply. We will let you know if the promotional code can’t be used against certain brands or product categories in your basket before you complete your purchase. 

                    h) Maximum 20% off beauty products (as listed in the Beauty category of the Website), regardless of the discount amount specified for the wider product range on the Website. 

                    i) Don’t use a promotional code to buy discounted products from Elegance, and then sell them on for a higher price to make yourself a bit of extra money. 

                    j) If you do use your promotional code in any of the ways listed above or in a way that we consider abuses the spirit in which the promotional code was issued, then we can cancel or withdraw your promotional code at any time, and without letting you know beforehand. 


                    e. Gift Vouchers


                    a) Once a gift voucher has been locked to an individual’s Elegance account, the gift voucher becomes their property.

                    b) After a gift voucher has been locked to an individual’s account, we reserve the right to refuse to discuss the gift voucher further, with the individual who initially purchased it.

                    c) Gift Vouchers are valid for 24 months, and you don’t have to spend them all at once.

                    Elegance shall have the right in its absolute discretion at any time and without notice to amend, remove or vary the Services and/or any page of this Website.

                    If any part of the Terms of Service is unenforceable (including any provision in which we exclude our liability to you) the enforceability of any other part of the Terms of Service will not be affected all other clauses remaining in full force and effect. So far as possible where any clause/sub-clause or part of a clause/sub-clause can be severed to render the remaining part valid, the clause shall be interpreted accordingly. Alternatively, you agree that the clause shall be rectified and interpreted in such a way that closely resembles the original meaning of the clause /sub-clause as is permitted by law.


                    We operate a complaints handling procedure which we will use to try to resolve disputes when they first arise: please let us know if you have any complaints or comments. If your dispute remains unresolved, you may be eligible to use the European Commission’s Online Dispute Resolution platform here. 


                    If you breach these conditions and we take no action, we will still be entitled to use our rights and remedies in any other situation where you breach these conditions.

                    These terms and conditions are to be construed in accordance with the laws of England and in the event of any dispute or claim associated with these terms and conditions, that dispute or claim shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts.


                    The above Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement of the parties and supersede any and all preceding and contemporaneous agreements between you and Elegance. Any waiver of any provision of the Terms of Service will be effective only if in writing and signed by a Director of Elegance.


                    As a reputable and trusted business committed to offering its customers high quality products, Elegance recognizes its obligation to ensure that suppliers are operating ethically. 


                    We expect our suppliers to consistently provide an environment which protects their employees' health and safety and basic human rights. 

                    All suppliers are expected to comply with their national employment laws and regulations with particular regard to: 

                    • Minimum age of employment 
                    • Freely chosen employment 
                    • Health and safety 
                    • Freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining 
                    • No discrimination 
                    • No harsh or inhumane treatment 
                    • Working hours 
                    • Rates of pay 
                    • Terms of employment 

                    Elegance will never knowingly source stock from countries which are in breach of the above principles. We also look to our suppliers to instil these principles when dealing with their own supplier base. 

                    Because of the sometimes complex nature of our suppliers' supply chain, it is not always possible to monitor and control the conditions of each individual involved in the production of our products. However, as Elegance continues to grow it recognises the importance of being proactive and doing everything within its power to support the rights of those involved in the manufacture of its goods.
